looks like want to run npm run dev in order to run things

using tailwind which might mess something up, to be seen!, followe dinstructions:

TODO: i think gonna try and host this on vercel

also this guy for animation (including scrolling animation):

using gh-pages package for deploying, run npm run deploy to do so
sometimes get something like 'ProcessError: fatal: a branch named 'gh-pages' already exists'
In this case go to node_modules/.cache/gh-pages and delete that directory *shrug*


look into this guy for component library:
